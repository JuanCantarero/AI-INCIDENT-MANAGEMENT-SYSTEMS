# AI-INCIDENT-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEMS

The use of machine learning, specially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has shown significant advantages in classification tasks in different fields such as industry and diagnostic medicine. Nevertheless, no tool able to classify urban incidents in an efficient way has been yet developed. In the context of smart cities, the application of these techniques promises to offer an innovative solution for intelligently managing urban incidents, thus improving the quality of life of citizens.

This project is built upon an internationally implemented platform dedicated to urban incident management. The main goal is to minimize the time spent by the users in the platform by automatically classifying the incidents with an accuracy over 80\%. By accomplishing this, not only will incidents be resolved more quickly, but the overall user experience will also be significantly improved.

During the development of the project, transfer learning is applied, taking as a basis some of the most widespread convolutional neural network architectures in the field of computer vision: squeezeNet, Resnet, VGG and MobileNet. Through data augmentation and subsequent exploration of the CNN hyperparameters, the model that provides the best accuracy is selected.

As a result, a model capable of successfully classifying up to 27 types of urban incidents using images of them has been developed. The model achieves an average classification accuracy of 81.34%, which exceeds the initial target. Although the model has room for improvement, we conclude that it is feasible to incorporate it into the urban incident management platform, since it would further automate it and improve its efficiency.
